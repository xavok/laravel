                            CalOPPA is the first state law in the U.S. to require commercial websites and online services to post
                            a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the
                            U.S. (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting  Personally Identifiable Information
                            (PII) from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly
                            the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.

                            When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old,
                            the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission,
                            United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of
                            websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically
                            market to children under the age of 13 years old. See  more at:
